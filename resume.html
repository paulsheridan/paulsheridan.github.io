            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I excel at driving outcomes that align with business needs while making the most of available resources. My approach
            focuses on implementing the simplest infrastructure changes to deliver the biggest gains, ensuring every step adds
            measurable value. I’m also skilled at diving deep into complex domain problems, gaining a thorough understanding to
            create effective and lasting solutions.

            My experience spans two critical stages of technology leadership. In the early stages, I thrive in environments that
            demand rapid iteration, flexibility, and the ability to pivot quickly. Later, I bring value in mature organizations
            where technology and processes are stable and scaled, and where thoughtful, incremental changes can result in
            significant financial impact.</p>
